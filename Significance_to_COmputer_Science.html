<h1>Significance to Computer Science </h1>
<p>
    Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web in 1989, which completely changed how people use the Internet. Before his invention, the internet was mostly used by scientists and was difficult for ordinary people to access. By creating the first web browser and website, he made it easier for everyone to use and navigate the internet. His work is extremely important in computer science because it allowed the internet to grow into what it is today, connecting people all over the world and enabling the spread of information like never before. Even as a child, Berners-Lee was fascinated by computers. He also enjoyed mathematics and electronics. He attended the University of Oxford and graduated in 1976 with a degree in physics.
